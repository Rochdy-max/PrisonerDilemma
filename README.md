# PrisonerDilemma
This is result of trying to build a program simulating the famous concept of prisoner's dilemma with a clean software design.

## What is the prisoner's dilemma ?
Let's assume that we have two prisoners, they must cooperate to regain their freedom. A policeman, now has to gather some proofs of involvement of any to them in a murder case. To do that, he proceeds by separating them and talking to them one after the other. Thus, the prisonners have two choices, be silent or denounces the other. At each turn, they can get some points:
- If one denounces the second and the seceond doesn't, the second take 10 years of jail.
- If both of them denounces each other, 5 years of jail is added to their penalty.
- If both of them stay silent, there is no penalty.

After all, we cummulate the penalties and the one with the most penalties lose the game.
